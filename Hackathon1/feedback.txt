Hello Yaniv this is your Hackaton feedback. The idea of your app is interesting. Remember that when you are 
asking a user to log in you should get the chance to create users. In the future you will learn a way to register 
your users in your aplications in an easier way. So later on you could finish the project. 
Good work in manipulating the form and the DOM and creating event listeners.

COngratulations on your project.
